 Hi <%= @user.name.titleize %>,

==========================================================================================================================================

 We at <%=  Rails.application.credentials[:mail][:frontend_name] %> received a request from someone (hopefully you!) telling us that you lost (or can't remember) your password. 
 If that's the case, just click on the link below and we'll take you to where you can change your password. If you didn't submit a password recovery request, just ignore this email -- your account has in no way been compromised.

 
 Recover Your Password: <<%= link_to "#{Rails.application.credentials[:mail][:frontend_url]}passwordrecovery/#{@user.reset_password_token}" , "#{Rails.application.credentials[:mail][:frontend_url]}/password_recovery/#{@user.reset_password_token}" %>


Note: If you want to change your password, you must click the link above within the next 5 hours. After that, the link will expire for your protection. If you still need to recover your password, just start the password recovery process over from the beginning.

Best Regards,
The <%=  Rails.application.credentials[:mail][:frontend_name] %> Team
